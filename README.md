# ðŸŽ¨ PRODiGY_GENAI_02 â€“ Image Generation with Pre-trained Diffusion Models

This project demonstrates the use of pre-trained **text-to-image generation models** like **DALLÂ·E mini** and **Stable Diffusion** to create images based on natural language prompts. The task is part of the **Generative AI Internship** at Prodigy InfoTech.
